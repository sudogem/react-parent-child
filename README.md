# react-parent-child

#### How to install everything:   
$ npm install   
Once installed successfully, you can run the app in two(2) different ways:
$ npm run build   <em>// runs the Webpack in production mode</em>   
$ npm run dev     // runs the Webpack in the watch mode   

When running `npm run build` make sure that you physically delete the files inside build/ folder.

#### Runs the webpack in the watch mode which will automatically bundle the file whenever there is a change detected then open the main.html in your browser
$ webpack -d --watch or npm run dev   


#### To install the modules individually:
$ npm install react react-dom --save   
$ npm install babel-core --save   
$ npm install babel-loader babel-preset-es2015 babel-preset-react -S   
$ npm install webpack --save-dev   
$ npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev
